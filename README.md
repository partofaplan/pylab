# Python Lab work

This repo houses my various python projects. 

1. ado_pool_status = Working. Deploys an AWS lammbda that uses the Azure Devops API to scour your current agent pools, then it uses the status of the agents in those Agent Pools to say whether a pool is online or not. This data is then sent to New Relic.

2. pick_a_q_form_app = Non-working. Deploys a web form for helping F3 users find open Q spots and sign up to them.
